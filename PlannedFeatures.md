# Planned Features

## Features
  - Progressbar show job count
  - Fetch preview on progress percent of sampling steps (10 / 100 => 10%). Instead of fixed step count. Useful when generating different step count.
  - Shutdown server button
  - User permissions

## BugFix
  - ProgressBar performance counter on job count > 1
